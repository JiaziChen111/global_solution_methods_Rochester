Step 0: Go to Github: https://github.com/sischei/global_solution_methods_Rochester
        Download and unzip to your mian folder, the name would be global_solution_methods_Rochester-master

Step 1: [setup] Go to /home/mfang2(Your NetID)/global_solution_methods_Rochester-master/Lecture_1/SparseGridCode
Install necessary packages (IPOPT is preinstalled by CIRC stuff for us, so I commented it out in install_SG.sh)       
$: cd global_solution_methods_Rochester-master/Lecture_1/SparseGridCode
$: sh install_SG.sh

Step 2: in terminal, before you run any code 
$: module load ipopt/3.12.12/b2

Step 3: [first time] go to current path to test if IPOPT works, run the test example, should be very quick
$: cd global_solution_methods_Rochester-master/Lecture_1/SparseGridCode
$: python hs071.py

Step 4: go to example folders to tun the code. (it takes time to solve, so just be patient)
$: cd growth_model/serial (or other example folders)
$: python main.py

*for all other examples, repeat Step 1 + Step 3 
*for all other questions of running issues on BlueHive, email me at min.fang@rochester.edu or CIRC@rochester.edu

Let's enjoy the lecture,
Ethan
